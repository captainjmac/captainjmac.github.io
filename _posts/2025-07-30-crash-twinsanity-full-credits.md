When Crash Twinsanity was released, our studio manager, Steve Riding, decided to omit individual roles from the Traveller's Tales Oxford team in the credits.

This has always bugged me, so I've decided to write out the full unredacted credits here for posterity.

### Uncredited

It's a regular practice in the games industry to exclude people from the credits, usually if they've left the studio part way through development. Generally this is done at the whim of studio management. I object to this practice so I've included here people who worked on the project and were left out of the official credits. If I forgot anyone, please let me know!!

## Design't department
![JMac's Tropy](/assets/img/participation-trophy.jpg){:class="image-40 image-wrap"}

It might be worth going into a bit more detail about the design department, as that is where my role lay, and where a lot of the chaos originated! 

We originally had a fairly large design department when the project was known as Crash Evolution. I was the third designer on the team, with Dax & James being there before me. We were up to 5 people at one point, myself included. After this period, the project went sour, and the original Lead Designer left followed by 2 others. 

Nana and myself remained as the sole designers after the project was rebooted, intially as "Crash Unlimited", and Paul G. became Creative Director after previously being artist & animator. We tried to hire some more designers but it didn't work out. Nana left soon afterwards, leaving me as the sole remaining person who was hired as a designer, with Paul G as Creative Director. 

We were then joined by David Robinson. He initially worked for Vivendi as an external producer, and for reasons unknown to myself, he decided to leave them and come and work directly with us as our in-house producer. He then took on some of the game design responsibilities as well.  

We never had anyone in the official capacity of Lead Designer after that point, with various aspects of that role either being handled variously by Paul G, Dave R. and myself, or forgotten about entirely! No more attempts were made to hire any designers at all. Instead we hired 3 programmers, and they covered a lot of the day to day work that would usually be performed by the design department. Those were Jon E, Kingsley S & Alex W.

Towards the end of development (3-4 months before release I think), we absorbed a number of staff from a local studio which went bust. This was [LTStudios](https://www.mobygames.com/company/4699/ltstudios-ltd/). Neall Jones joined as part of this group, and he became design manager of our next project (Super Monkey Ball Adventure), but wasn't around long enough to assist significantly with the design of Twinsanity

I hope that serves to explain some of the craziness and inconsistency in the finished product!!
