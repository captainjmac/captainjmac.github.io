Youtube is simultaneously the best and worse thing on the internet. It's full of useful videos you can use to learn and improve your life, it's also full of timewasting dross. It's easy to fall into the trap of an endless doomtubing session. 

Isotube is a tool I made to help you stick to the useful stuff, and prevent you from getting distracted with other videos that you didn't intend to watch.

It's quite simple, you can build your own video playlists within IsoTube, and it plays them using an embedded youtube player, without allowing you to click the embedded player, so you can't follow links to other windows.

The intention is that you build lists of useful videos, and then watch them in IsoTube.

It works completely locally in your browser, it doesn't upload any data about your playlists to a server, it stores everything in your browsers local storage. For that reason, there's an import/export feature if you need to permanently backup your playlists.

This tool is quite early work in progress so if you like it, please contact me with any bugs/feature suggestions!
